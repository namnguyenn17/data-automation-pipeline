## Important Notes

### Cost Considerations

- Each AI analysis call uses OpenAI tokens
- Individual stock analysis: ~1,000-1,500 tokens
- Comparative analysis: ~1,200-2,000 tokens
- Current GPT-4 pricing: ~$0.03 per 1,000 tokens
- Consider using GPT-3.5-turbo for lower costs (set `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo`)

### Investment Disclaimer

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The AI analysis is for educational and informational purposes only. It is NOT financial advice. Always:

- Do your own research
- Consult with financial professionals
- Consider your risk tolerance
- Diversify your investments
- Never invest more than you can afford to lose

### Data Sources

The AI analysis combines:
- **Technical Data**: From Yahoo Finance (price, volume, indicators)
- **Financial Data**: From Yahoo Finance (income statements, balance sheets)
- **Market Context**: The AI model's training data (up to its knowledge cutoff)

## Troubleshooting

### "AI Analysis requires OpenAI API key"

- Ensure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set
- Restart the Streamlit app after setting environment variables
- Check that your API key is valid and has credits

### "Analysis failed" Error

- Check your internet connection
- Verify your OpenAI API key has available credits
- Try with a smaller number of stocks for comparative analysis
- Check the logs for detailed error messages

### Analysis Taking Too Long

- The AI analysis can take 10-30 seconds per stock
- For multiple stocks, consider analyzing them one at a time
- Using GPT-3.5-turbo is faster than GPT-4
